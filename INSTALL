Install Steps

1) Enter database details into install.php
	(Replace DATABASE_USERNAME, DATABASE_NAME and
	 DATABASE_PASSWORD with applicable information)
2) Run install.php
3) If install.php ran successfully (no error messages) then
	delete it.
4) Look at listupdater.php and lookup.php example files for
	basic methods on using the system.
5) If you choose to use listupdater.php then set it as a cron
	job to run every minute. NOTE: It will not actually
	update every minute but will ping the check file.
	This is required in case of Backoff procedures and 
	timeouts'.
